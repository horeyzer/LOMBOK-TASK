# LOMBOK-TASK
The task involves using the Lombok library in the task in which we built our model class using the example of Car (Labs4, Task2).
The task is about this:
- adding the Lombok library to Intellij and the project,
- removing all methods, constructor, etc. from the Car class - we only leave the fields,
- in a class with the main method, adding a second object, using the eqauls() and hashCode() methods on these two objects.
- the entire code above should compile (thanks to the Lombok library and the use of appropriate annotations) and print information to the console as in the printScreen on the next slide. Please note that the eqauls() method returns true, and the hashCode() method returns the same value - even though we are comparing two different objects.
Ps. I deliberately do not show what is before the 10th line of code - this is part of your task.
Ps.2. Lombok Libraries is one of the basic external libraries used in commercial projects. Knowing and using it significantly shortens our code without losing its readability. It's really worth knowing and using it - if we are thinking about commercial programming.
Ps.3. Moreover, other languages have similar libraries designed to reduce boilerplate code, for Python it is Paprika, and for C# it is AutoFixture.
